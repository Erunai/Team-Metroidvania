This project began as a university assignment. When experiencing the current state of the game, please recognise that it is in a very early (hardly alpha) state.
There are many known bugs which you will likely encounter.

Currently, the game opens to the main menu, which plays the
original music that I had made for the game (planning to swap
this out in the future). After starting the game, the player
can't move until pressing E. In level 1, the new music that I
plan to use for most of the demo plays. After completing the
current state of level 1, you move to a playground area. This
area has a few extra enemies with placeholder appearances
(generally just made up of basic sprites). In this area, there
are 10 possible points to be obtained. If your health drops to
zero, you respawn with one less score. Keep in mind, you only
have a maximum of 2 health! When you finish, you can find a
restart button in the pause menu so you can try getting a
better score. Goodluck!
